# Godot-RTS-Camera-Updated
Updated RTS Camera, works much better.
Smooth camera with the ability to customize the camera completely, go wild!
I mean play with the editor exports, and don't open the camera.gd unless you want to, it's a lot of mess, I'll improve the camera later on.

This camera will be used in OpenSkyCity, so I will keep the camera up-to-date with the features I had in mind.

Todo for this camera:
```
1. Implement Speed Boost (Boost the speed with multiplier if the keys are kept pressed for more than 2 secs)
2. Implement following (Camera will follow specific item, if it is destroyed the camera will be placed back to where it was, can be customized to place it as it is or offset it by x units.)
3. Implement more options (Like, Inverting y, inverting rotations, inverting zoom, etc)
4. Implement picture in picture mode (Like in OpenTTD and Transport Fever 2, will support customizations.)
```
and that's it!

Instruction to use the camera:
```
1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy over Camera.tscn and Camera.gd
3. Instantiate Camera.tscn into your scene, customize it.
4. and try out the game
5. customize it even more
6. try out the game
```
And enjoy!
